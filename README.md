# Next.js 15 Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where a seemingly correct page fails to render its content, resulting in a blank screen.  The issue is resolved by ensuring proper hydration and data fetching mechanisms within the application.

## Bug Description

A Next.js 15 application, built using the standard `pages` directory approach, unexpectedly shows a blank page upon navigation.  The page component contains basic HTML elements, yet nothing is rendered in the browser.  Console shows no errors related to the rendering process itself.
